I created this minimal blogs using HTML, Tailwind CSS and PHP.
There are 6 files (home.php, blog.php, single.php, contact.php, submit.php) including a responsive CSS file.

I faced problem to making the website responsive using Tailwind CSS. Since I'm a beginer in Tailwind CSS, I haven't experience in responsive design. But It will complete soon.
That's why I added some custom responsive CSS. File name is responsive.css
